"""Launcher for the FastAPI web app.

The app itself lives in `web/server.py` at the repo root, next to `avb/`
rather than inside it. That is deliberate: `web/` is an application shell
(templates, static assets, HTTP routes) and does not belong in the library
package that `pip install ai-video-builder` ships.

The consequence is that this launcher has to find `web/` on disk. When the
package is installed, `web/` is not on sys.path, so we locate it relative to
this file's parent directory and fall back gracefully with a clear message
rather than a confusing ImportError.
